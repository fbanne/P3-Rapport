\chapter*{Preface}
The following report is made by 5 computer science students at Aalborg University. It is made on the third semester from the second of September to the 20th December. The groups counsellor was Emmanouil Valsomatzis.

The report accounts for a problem with multimedia recommendation. In the report there is also a chapter of designing and programming of a website, which is used to solve the problem.

The website runs in all popular browsers, but looks the best in Google Chrome, which is the browser that has been focused on, while testing the website.
