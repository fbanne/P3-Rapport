% Target Audience Section
To find our target audience we first want to examine who might be interested in our potential solution. To do this we have taken several different approaches, first we created personas and use cases to try and get an idea of what groups of people we want to target our program towards. To try and confirm our assumptions, further understand who our target audience is and also define them more accurately, we did interviews.
