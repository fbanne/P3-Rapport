Through doing our personas and use cases we got a deeper understanding of who is going to be our target audience. We started by creating personas for three of what seemed like the most obvious users, while constructing situations where our project could be useful. Along with helping form our interviews it also helped form our program through showing what kinds of features different audiences might want.

It also helped show us what age groups we might want to ignore. Because children and people with certain disabilities, particularly bad eyesight, impose certain restrictions on a potential solution, restrictions that are not immediately necessary for our program to function. It was decided to exclude these two groups from our initial requirements. Note that we consider kids to be everyone younger than 17 years, because that is the oldest age restriction you can find on media(in EU at least). Based on that it was decided to focus our solution towards people from 17 and up and people without disabilities.
