Through doing our personas and use cases we got a deeper understanding of who is going to be our target audience. We started by creating personas for three of what seemed like the most obvious users, while constructing situation where our project could might be useful. Along with helping form our interviews it also helped form our program, through showing what kinds of features different audiences might want.

It also helped showing us what age groups we might want to ignore. Because children and people with certain disabilities, particularly bad eyesight, impose certain restrictions on a potential solution, restrictions that is not immediately necessary for our program to function, we have decided to exclude these groups from our initial demands for the program. Note that we consider kids to be everyone younger than 17 years, because that is the oldest age restriction you can find on media(in EU at least). Based on that we have decided to focus our solution towards people in their late teens and people without disabilities.
