%Survey Section
To find out how people generally perceive media recommendations, it was decided that there had to be collected data from potential users. For that reason both an interview and a questionnaire were conducted. This was also done for the purpose of approximating a more precise target audience and find possible weights based on real data. This section will look at and discuss the data collected from the interview and questionnaire, and what was learned from doing these activities.
