The questionnaires showed that all age groups have, to some degree, an interest in media. All age groups also seems to put more weight on the more apparent features of a piece of media, like the cast or the artist, and especially the genre. The same also seems to apply to how much they weigh whether or not a recommendations is from a friend, and their own opinion.

There was an overabundance of responses from the 21-25 age group, which can most likely be attributed to the group members entourage. It could be seen though, that generally, as the age group became older, the responses seemed to turn more apathetic. Still, it is hard to determine a precise age group, since responses from older people is scarce, and there isnâ€™t enough responses to confidently determine anything. It does help validate that there is an interest among younger people.
