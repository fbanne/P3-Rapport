Earlier in \ref{Existing} page \pageref{Existing} we looked at a broad spectrum of recommendation techniques and  split them into three groups and a fourth being a combination of the first three. Now we will look closer at what we earlier identified as the personal and social recommendations, when looking at them from a more technical standpoint it makes more sense to group them after what sources they use and how they use them.

Picture \ref{RecTypes} shows the four recommendation systems and what sources they use. Sometimes the sources available dictates which recommender the system must use unless a hybrid is chosen.
