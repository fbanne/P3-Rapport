From a business standpoint there are several common uses of recommendation systems[REF]:

\subsubsection{Product Recommendations}

A very common use of recommendation systems today is at online retailers. The websites often collect information using automatic personalization and then compare the user with similar users from which they recommend other items.

\subsubsection{Movie Recommendations}

Websites like Netflix use a lot of resources on optimizing recommending movies to the user based on the users ratings on watched movies. They even offered a prize for a million dollars to the developer who could beat their recommendation system by 10\% and the prize was won in 2009 by the team "Bellkor's Pragmatic Chaos".

\subsubsection{News Articles}

Another use for recommendation systems is recommending news articles or blogs that might be of interest to the reader based on what they have read in the past. The system can identify important words in the documents and from those find similar documents to recommend or it can look at similar users and recommend articles or blogs based on what they have also read.
