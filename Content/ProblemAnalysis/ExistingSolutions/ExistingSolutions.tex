According to Alex Iskold, from readwrite.com, there are four approaches for recommendation. The first approach is personalized recommendation which is based on the individualâ€™s past behavior. The second approach is social recommendation which is based on the past behavior of similar users. The third approach is item recommendation which is based on the item itself. The last approach is a combination of the all three approaches mentioned above. With these four approaches this section will look at solutions on existing recommendation systems. \cite{ReadWrite}

The four approaches are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Personalized recommendation - recommend things based on the individual's past behavior. 
	\item Social recommendation - recommend things based on the past behavior  of similar users. 
	\item Item recommendation - recommend things based on the item itself.
	\item A combination of the three approaches.
\end{itemize}
