The most common recommendation type between the four existing solutions is the personalized kind of recommendations. This is followed by the social recommendation type. Item recommendation is visible on some of the solutions, but is less used compared to the other recommendation types.

Personalized and social recommendations seems to fit into collaborative filtering, while item recommendations falls into content-based filtering recommender systems. To cover all possibilities, a hybrid recommendations seems to be the best option, considering Amazonâ€™s success with this kind of recommendation system.

It seems like the personalized and social recommendations is the most important, considering what this project is aiming for. Item recommendation is based solely on data regarding a specific item, rather than a recommendation based on the person's interests, past behavior, and similarities with other people. This will be further investigated in the survey section to find out what people weigh the most, when they receive new media they might consume, or find themselves.
