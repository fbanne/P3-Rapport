In a study conducted by Harris Interactive \cite{Harris} in 2010 among 2.311 U.S. adults ages 18 and over on how they use and feel about interaction on the internet. They asked different questions and some of them are quite interesting.
Although it was conducted in America the information can still be used in our project, since the idea behind our project is to create a website that can be accessed from across the world. Different studies in different countries can be useful to help determine target groups.

The first graph, figure \ref{Teori1}, shows what the interviewees share through social media. They were to select all that applies to them. If we take a look at what the different options were, one stands out: TV and movie recommendations. In the range of 18 to 34 years-old, 36 percent of them says that they share TV and movie recommendations through social media.

The second graph, figure \ref{Teori2}, asks the question about how different things influence them. It shows that 71 percent of those asked, replied that they are influenced a great deal or a fair amount by reviews from family members or friends. That shows that social recommendation is something that a lot of people have in mind when it comes to buying or watching something.

The third and last graph, figure \ref{Teori3}, shows the age group of those asked the previous question. That graph shows that the 18 to 34 years-old are more influenced by blogs and social media, than older people. At the same time older people are more influenced by their family and friends.
