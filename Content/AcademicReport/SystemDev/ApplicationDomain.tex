The application-domain is how various actors interact with the system, and through that controls, documents, and observes the problem-domain. Actors can be any exterior entity which is connected to the usage of the system, like people, but can also include external systems. These actors have various use cases available to be them, which lets them perform actions on the system.

\subsubsection{Actors \& Use Cases}

For this system there are only two kinds of actors: The ‘user’, and what has been named the ‘updater’.

The user is the general media interested person who use the system to find media he might be interested in, which is his purpose in the context of the system. He has a medialist, where he rates and indicates media, which he has consumed. He also has a friends list where he makes connections with other people he know, or shares interests with. The unique characteristic of a user is his medialist and preferences, which can alter the recommendation process, generating different results.

The updater is an external system. Its purpose is to update the media which the system has available to it, with information coming from various sources. This is done to keep the system updated with newly released media, and is made available for the users to add to their medialists. The characteristic of an updater is the media types it keeps track of, and the sources it extracts these data from.

The use cases is the various actions the actors can perform in the application-domain. The use cases include: See medialist, see friendlist, indicate/rate media, remove media, add friend, remove friend, and update media collection. These have been made into a table, with actors, indicating which use case belongs to which actor. See Table \ref{UseTable}.

Among these the use case 'Generate recommendations' could also be included. This depends on how this use case is activated, as it may not be the most sensible choice to have available to all users. The more sensible choice would be to activate it in certain intervals, to avoid a user abusing the action, possibly slowing or crashing the system. It will not be included in this use case table.

\begin{table}[htb]

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline
	  & \textbf{User} & \textbf{Updater} \\ \hline
	\textbf{See Medialist} & X &  \\ \hline
	\textbf{See Friendlies} & X &  \\ \hline
	\textbf{Indicate/Rate Media} & X &  \\ \hline
	\textbf{Remove Media} & X &  \\ \hline
	\textbf{Add Friend} & X &  \\ \hline
	\textbf{Remove Friend} & X &  \\ \hline
	\textbf{Update Media Collection} &  & X \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Use Case table}
\label{UseTable}
\end{table}

The following two figures shows the use cases: indicate/rate media, and update media collections. These two were singled out for being the more unique patterns of use among those available, and the more important among them. See Figure \ref{IndicateMedia} for the indicate/rate media use case and Figure \ref{UpdateCollection} for the update media collection use case.

\caption{Diagram of the Indicate/Rate Media use case}
\label{IndicateMedia}
\end{figure}

The indicate/rate media use case is initiated by the user, when he wants to add a piece of media, together with a rating, to his medialist. The user inserts the title of a media, which then have to be confirmed before the use case begins to check whether or not the piece of media exists in the systems collections. If the media was not in the collection, the use case will stop. If the media was, it will wait for the user to indicate his rating for the media, and will then finish the use case by saving it in the users' medialist. Involved objects include the media interested person, and the media objects.

\caption{Diagram of the Update Media Collection use case}
\label{UpdateCollection}
\end{figure}

The update media collection is either initiated in a certain interval, or when new media content is detected available for the system. This case shows the former possibility. This use case starts by checking external collections upon being initiated, and will either end if no new media content was detected, or will begin retrieving said media content. After retrieving the media updates from the external collections, the use case will end by adding the media updates to the systems collections. Involved objects are several media objects. In the present prototype of the system the update media has to be initiated manually.

\subsubsection{Functions}

Functions is the methods which stands for most of the systems processing of data, and makes it possible for actors to communicate with the model of the system, through this function layer. Functions can include any of the use cases which has already been described, but there can also be additional functions, depending on the context of the system. For this system, there is a function called ‘Generate Recommendations’, which was excluded from the use cases on this case, but is still very crucial for the system. 

Functions are divided into four types: Update, read, calculate, and signal functions.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Update Functions
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Indicate/Rate media, remove media, add friend, remove friend, update media collection
	\end{itemize}
	\item Read Functions
	\begin{itemize}
		\item See media, see friends, search for media, and search for friends
	\end{itemize}
	\item Signal \& Calculate Functions
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Generate recommendations
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In this context, the generate recommendations function can easily go as both a signal and calculate function, as it has properties from both. It processes data from the model, generates recommendations based on this data, and then makes it viewable for the user, through the ‘See media’ function. The function itself is activated by a signal, like the user logging into their account, or a planned interval, without being specifically requested by the user.

The functions are shown in Table \ref{FuncTable}, showing their type and complexity.
