This section describes some of the areas which was taught doing the Algorithm and Data Structures, which ran parallel with the project. The section is based on the actual system which was created during the project, using theory taught during the course applied to algorithms to determine their running time, and analysis of sorting algorithms which were used to implement the algorithm. The theory is based on the textbook for the algorithm and data structures course, Introduction To Algorithms \cite{IntroToAlgorithms}.
