This section describes some of the areas taught during the Algorithms and Data Structures course that ran parallel with the project. The section is based on the actual system created during the project, applying theories to our algorithms to determine their running time and analysis of sorting algorithms. The theories are based on the textbook for the algorithm and data structures course, Introduction To Algorithms \cite{IntroToAlgorithms}.
